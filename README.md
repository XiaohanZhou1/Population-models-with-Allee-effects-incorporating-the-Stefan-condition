# Understanding the Influence of Diffusive Allee Effects in Population Models

This repository contains the code used to generate computational results for the first-year PhD report titled *Understanding the Influence of Diffusive Allee Effects in Population Models*. The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the effects of Allee effects and the Stefan condition on population dynamics, using computational methods.
